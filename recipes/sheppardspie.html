    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Favorite shepherd's pie recipe, a classic casserole of Britain and Ireland done American-style. Cook ground beef and savory vegetables, top with mashed potatoes, and bake to perfection.</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large (1 1/2 - pounds) potatoes, peeleed and quartered</li>
        <li>8 tablespoons (1/2 cup) butter</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped (about 1 1/2 cups) </li>
        <li>1 - 2 cups vegetables - diced carrots, corn, peas</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>2 large garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup beef broth</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 pound ground turkey breast</li>
        <li>Salt, pepper, other seasonings of choice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the peeled and quartered potatoes in medium sized pot. Cover with at least an inch of cold water. Add a teaspoon of salt. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until tender (about 20 minutes). </li>
        <li>While the potatoes are cooking, melt 4 tablespoons of the butter in a large sauté pan on medium heat. Add the chopped onions and cook until tender, about 6 to 10 minutes.
            If you are including vegetables, add them according to their cooking time. Carrots should be cooked with the onions, because they take as long to cook as the onions do.
            If you are including peas or corn, add them toward the end of the cooking of the onions, or after the meat starts to cook, as they take very little cooking time. </li>
        <li>Add ground beef to the pan with the onions and vegetables. Cook until no longer pink. Season with salt and pepper.
            Add the Worcestershire sauce and beef broth. Bring the broth to a simmer and reduce heat to low. Cook uncovered for 10 minutes, adding more beef broth if necessary to keep the meat from drying out. </li>
        <li>When the potatoes are done cooking (a fork can easily pierce), remove them from the pot and place them in a bowl with the remaining 4 Tbsp of butter. Mash with a fork or potato masher, and season with salt and pepper to taste. </li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400°F. Spread the beef, onions, and vegetables (if using) in an even layer in a large baking dish (9x13 casserole). Preheat oven to 400°F. Spread the beef, onions, and vegetables (if using) in an even layer in a large baking dish (9x13 casserole). </li>
        <li> Place in a 400°F oven and cook until browned and bubbling, about 30 minutes. If necessary, broil for the last few minutes to help the surface of the mashed potatoes brown.
            (Be careful when broiling using Pyrex or glass dishes, they have been known to shatter under the high heat of the broiler. It's not a worry if you are using a ceramic or metal casserole dish.) </li>
